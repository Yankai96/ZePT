    "Esophagus":"The esophagus starts at the pharynx, runs down the neck, passes through the thoracic cavity and diaphragm, and ends at the stomach, around the level of the T10 vertebra on thoracic and upper abdominal CT scans.The esophagus has a tubular shape, with a narrow lumen that can expand and contract based on the size of the food or liquid being swallowed.Anatomically, the esophagus is composed of four layers: mucosa (innermost layer), submucosa, muscularis propria (which has both circular and longitudinal muscle fibers), and adventitia (outermost layer); it also has two physiological sphincters at its top and bottom ends, preventing reflux from the pharynx or stomach.",
    "Liver":"The liver is located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, just below the diaphragm, and is visible in the corresponding region on abdominal CT scans.The liver has an irregular, wedge-like shape with a convex superior surface that fits under the diaphragm and a concave inferior surface.Anatomically, the liver is divided into two main lobes (the larger right lobe and the smaller left lobe) separated by the falciform ligament, and two smaller lobes (caudate and quadrate); it's covered by Glisson's capsule and contains a vast network of bile ducts, blood vessels (hepatic arteries, portal veins), and sinusoids.", 
    "Stomach":"The stomach is located in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen, predominantly under the left rib cage, stretching from the esophagus at the level of T10 vertebra to the duodenum at L1 vertebra, and is visible in the corresponding region on abdominal CT scans.The stomach has a J-shaped profile, with a larger left portion (the body) and a smaller right portion (the antrum).Anatomically, the stomach is divided into four sections: the cardia (where food enters), the fundus, the body (the main part), and the pylorus (which connects to the duodenum); internally, the lining of the stomach is highly folded to form gastric pits and glands which secrete stomach juices for digestion.",
    "Aorta":"The aorta originates from the left ventricle of the heart, ascending upwards (ascending aorta), then arches posteriorly and to the left (aortic arch), and descends in the thoracic and abdominal cavities (descending thoracic and abdominal aorta) before splitting into the two iliac arteries in the abdomen.The aorta is tubular in shape, maintaining a consistent lumen throughout most of its length, with slight dilations at the aortic root and the aortic arch.It is the main and largest artery in the human body, responsible for delivering oxygenated blood from the heart to the systemic circulation.", 
    "Postcava":"The inferior vena cava (IVC) is a large vein situated posterior to the abdominal cavity, beginning at the confluence of the common iliac veins (level of L5 vertebra) and ascending to the right of the aorta to enter the lower right atrium of the heart, with its course visible on abdominal CT scans.The IVC is tubular in shape and can present with various undulations or irregularities depending on factors like body position and internal pressures.Structurally, the IVC is the largest vein in the body responsible for transporting deoxygenated blood from the lower half of the body back to the heart, and it is made up of the typical venous three-layer structure: intima (inner layer), media (middle layer), and adventitia (external layer).", 
    "Portal Vein and Splenic Vein":"The portal vein is situated in the abdomen and is formed by the union of the superior mesenteric vein and the splenic vein, typically anterior to the inferior vena cava and posterior to the neck of the pancreas, with its location clearly delineated on abdominal CT scans.The portal vein is tubular in shape and is characterized by its bifurcation into left and right branches as it enters the liver.Structurally, the portal vein is responsible for transporting nutrient-rich and deoxygenated blood from the gastrointestinal tract and spleen to the liver for detoxification and metabolism. The splenic vein is located in the abdomen, running behind the pancreas and joining the superior mesenteric vein to form the portal vein, visible in its course on abdominal CT scans.The splenic vein is tubular and has a somewhat tortuous path, especially as it approaches its confluence with the superior mesenteric vein.Structurally, the splenic vein is responsible for draining deoxygenated blood from the spleen, parts of the stomach, and the pancreas, eventually contributing to the formation of the portal vein.",
    "Pancreas":"The pancreas is located in the upper middle part of the abdomen, behind the stomach, extending from the curve of the duodenum on the right to the spleen on the left, and is visible in the corresponding region on abdominal CT scans.The pancreas has an elongated and somewhat prismatic shape, with a wider head, a tapering body, and a narrow, pointed tail.Anatomically, the pancreas is divided into four parts: the head, neck, body, and tail; it is a compound gland which has both exocrine functions (secreting pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes into the duodenum) and endocrine functions (secreting insulin and glucagon into the bloodstream).", 
    "Right Adrenal Gland":"The right adrenal gland is situated in the retroperitoneal space, superior to the upper pole of the right kidney, adjacent to the posterior abdominal wall. Its crescent or semi-lunar shape is characterized by a convex outer edge and a closer inner edge. On abdominal CT scans, its position can be discerned.

    "Kidney Tumor":"A kidney tumor originates in the kidneys, bean-shaped organs located on either side of the spine, behind the abdominal organs, and just above the waistline.Kidney tumors can have varying shapes, often appearing as a solid mass or cystic lesion within or on the kidney.Depending on the type, a kidney tumor may affect the renal cortex, medulla, renal pelvis, or the renal capsule, with varying degrees of invasiveness.",
    "Liver Tumor":"A liver tumor can arise in any of the liver's lobes or segments, and its precise location, whether in the right lobe, left lobe, caudate, or other segments, can be accurately depicted on abdominal CT scans.Liver tumors can manifest in various shapes, ranging from round to irregularly contoured masses, depending on the type and stage of the tumor.Anatomically, a liver tumor may appear as a hypoechoic or hyperechoic lesion on ultrasound, with CT or MRI showing characteristics like enhancement patterns, presence of necrosis, and vascular invasion that can aid in its characterization and differentiation from benign lesions.",
    "Pancreas Tumor":"Pancreatic tumors can arise from any part of the pancreas, including the head, body, or tail, and are best visualized on abdominal CT scans with intravenous contrast during the pancreatic phase.Pancreatic tumors might appear as solid, cystic, or mixed lesions, and their borders can range from well-defined to irregular.On CT scans, pancreatic tumors may demonstrate varying enhancements and can be associated with pancreatic ductal dilation, vascular encasement, or invasion of nearby structures.", 
    "Hepatic Vessel Tumor":"Tumors of the hepatic vessels primarily arise from or involve the main branches of the hepatic artery or portal vein and are best visualized on contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scans.Tumors associated with hepatic vessels may appear as intraluminal filling defects, extraluminal masses, or vessel wall thickenings.On CT scans, these tumors may demonstrate enhancement patterns that differ from the surrounding liver parenchyma, potentially causing vessel displacement, compression, or invasion.",
    "Lung Tumor":"While lung tumors primarily reside within the lung parenchyma, only tumors situated in the lower segments of the lungs might be partially visualized on the upper sections of an abdominal CT scan.The shape of a lung tumor can be spherical, irregular, or lobulated, with some demonstrating spiculated or 'sunburst' patterns that signify invasive growth.Lung tumors may present with varying degrees of density (solid, part-solid, or ground-glass opacities) and can be associated with surrounding inflammation, atelectasis, or post-obstructive pneumonia, depending on the type and location of the tumor.", 
    "Colon Tumor":"Colon tumors can arise in any segment of the colon, from the cecum to the rectum, and are most clearly visualized in abdominal CT scans with intravenous and oral contrast.Colon tumors can appear as sessile (flat-based) or pedunculated (stalk-based) growths, with some demonstrating a circumferential 'apple-core' configuration, particularly in advanced stages.On CT scans, colon tumors can present with varying densities and might be associated with surrounding inflammation, adjacent organ invasion, or regional lymph node enlargement.",
    "Kidney Cyst":"A kidney cyst is located in the kidneys, which are bean-shaped organs situated on either side of the spine, behind the abdominal organs, just above the waistline.Kidney cysts are typically round or oval and have a thin, clear wall that contains fluid.Most kidney cysts are simple cysts, meaning they are sacs that are filled with fluid and don't contain septa, calcifications, or solid components. They usually form on the surface of the kidney, but they can also develop within the kidney's structure."
